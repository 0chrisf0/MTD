  "Our project is a Cornell-themed tower defense game where dart-throwing
  bears will defend our beloved McGraw Tower from oncoming balloons. 
  Bears can be dragged and dropped anywhere on the map to pop balloons, wave
  by wave. 
  
  We will be using the RayLib module in OCaml as our graphical user interface
  and design our bears, balloons, maps from scratch."
